This is the first project from the Odin Project curriculum.

It is a basic recipe website.

2.  Creation of html webpages that implement the use of:
    1.  Heading elements
    2.  Paragraph elements
    3.  Hyperlink reference elements
    4.  Image elements
    5.  The use of unordered and ordered lists
